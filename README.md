# XenServerBackup
Script to backup XenServer Virtual Machines

This is a Visual Basic Script to perform live backups from XenServer hosts.

The script was originally written by Martin Pugh and posted on SpiceWorks at:  http://community.spiceworks.com/scripts/show/161-xenserver-live-backup.

At the time of writing this readme file, the script is 3 years old and Martin cannot continue development. He allowed the code to remain posed and expressed in the comments that anyone is free to work with it.

I belive that this is a good base to provide a script that allows for backup of XenServer guests and continue development to improve and adapt the code for new versions of XenServer.
